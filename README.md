# Signal

The purpose of this project is to maximize the amount of signal we recieve about each candidate when they complete our code test.  The perfect code test maximizes signal while minimizing time.  We value feedback.  If you love, hate, or otherwise wish to help us improve our signal project please open an issue.  

# Evaluation

We are looking for future team members to demonstrate there skill level.  Please review the evaluation criteria so you understand how we will be looking at this assignment.
