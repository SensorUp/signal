# Signal

The purpose of this project is to maximize the amount of signal we receive about each candidate when they complete our code test.  The perfect code test maximizes signal while minimizing time.  We value feedback.  If you love, hate, or otherwise wish to help us improve our signal project please open an issue.  

# Evaluation

We are looking for future team members to demonstrate their skill level.  Please review the evaluation criteria so you understand how we will be looking at this assignment.  We are expecting candidates to limit the time spent (and have limited time available) so we are not expecting all the boxes checked.  We look forward to discussing with you which boxes you prioritized and why.

# Features

The Government of Canada wishes to provide the Canada Food Guide as an online service to improve the health of Canadians.  To test the idea an MVP was outlined by the product owner.  They are looking to adopt modern cloud-based methodologies to deploy a scalable healthy eating API.  

The roadmap includes adding preference features and automatic weekly shopping lists with options to set up healthy grocery delivery via Amazon Prime. This roadmap is out of scope for this project.

# Data 

Open data from the [Canada Food Guide](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/e5f4a98e-0ccf-4e5e-9912-d308b46c5a7f) is provided under the `/data` folder. 

# Interface

A user interface is not required but is considered optional for candidates who wish to demonstrate their client side superpowers.  

# Submissions

- Candidates are encouraged to provide these results on their personal Github profile `https://github.com/candidate/signal` as a public repo or alternatively a private repo.  

- Downloading and initiallizing a new repo is preferable to forking as other candidates may see your public fork.  

*If private repo please add `jchang-sensorup`, `kanluo`, `liangsteve`, `thespencercox` as external collaborators*
